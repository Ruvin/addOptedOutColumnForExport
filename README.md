## SuiteCRM Add Opted-Out Column For Export of Contacts

### What's in this repository 

SuiteCRM addOptedOutColumnForExport Module

The standard SuiteCRM doesn't have a option to export OPTED-OUT records, when exporting data from Contacts. This module enables the functionality to extract records of OPTED-OUT and you can see a new column with data on your CSV file called 'Opted Out' when you extract records from the Contacts.


More information about 'Opted Out' field can also be found here: [visit support.sugarcrm.com][suitecrm]
